						<p>Cryptocurrencies are digital assets designed to function as a medium of exchange, leveraging cryptographic techniques to ensure secure, decentralized transactions. Unlike traditional currencies, they operate on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Bitcoin, introduced in 2009, was the pioneer, but today&apos;s cryptocurrency landscape includes thousands of options, such as Ethereum, which enables smart contracts, and Ripple, which focuses on fast, cross-border payments.</p>
						<p>These digital currencies offer several advantages, including lower transaction fees and financial inclusivity. However, they also face significant challenges, such as regulatory scrutiny, high volatility, and security concerns. The market&apos;s rapid evolution has sparked debate about their long-term viability and their potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. As technology advances and regulations develop, the role of cryptocurrencies in global finance remains both promising and uncertain.</p>
